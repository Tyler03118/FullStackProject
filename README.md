## 🏸 Project Description
The project is a student management system using SpringBoot 2 and PostgreSQL for the backend and React.js for the front end. In addition, I also deploy the application to AWS, making it available to real users to use. 

## 🏏 Key Implementations:
- Initialized projects leveraging Spring Initializr and Create React App, ensuring rapid development.
- Seamlessly integrated a Docker-enabled PostgreSQL with Spring Boot, with CRUD operations managed via Spring's JDBC Template.
- Enhanced user experience with an intuitive UI, built using AntD components, accommodating varied user interactions including form submissions, data retrieval, and updates.
- Implemented comprehensive error-handling mechanisms across both frontend and backend, minimizing user disruptions.
- Oversaw seamless database migrations with Flyway, coupled with Maven-automated builds.
- Executed a smooth deployment to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk, ensuring scalability and accessibility.
